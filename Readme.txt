Binance Arbitrage Bot - README
Overview
This project is an automated Binance arbitrage bot designed to capitalize on price differences between various cryptocurrency exchanges or liquidity pools. The bot monitors price fluctuations and executes trades when arbitrage opportunities arise. Additionally, it supports integration with Ethereum-based DeFi protocols like Uniswap and uses flash loans.

Features
Multi-exchange Arbitrage: Automates the process of identifying and exploiting arbitrage opportunities across Binance and other platforms.
Liquidity Pool Monitoring: Fetches liquidity data from pools to ensure profitable trade execution.
Smart Contract Integration: Supports Ethereum smart contracts, including flash loans via Solidity (flash_loan.sol).
Modular Architecture: Structured into development, testing, and production-ready components, making it easy to extend and maintain.
